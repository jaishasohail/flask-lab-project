# 🎉 Getting Started with Your Flask Lab Project

Congratulations! Your complete Flask Lab Project is ready. Follow these steps to get started.

## 📥 What You Have

You now have a complete, production-ready Flask application with:

✅ **Backend**: Flask application with RESTful API  
✅ **Frontend**: Responsive HTML/CSS/JavaScript interface  
✅ **Tests**: Comprehensive unit test suite  
✅ **Docker**: Full containerization support  
✅ **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions pipeline  
✅ **Documentation**: Complete guides and instructions  

## 🚀 Quick Start (Choose Your Path)

### Option A: Extract and Run Immediately

1. **Extract the project:**
   ```bash
   # If you have the .tar.gz file:
   tar -xzf flask-lab-project.tar.gz
   cd flask-lab-project
   
   # If you have the directory:
   cd flask-lab-project
   ```

2. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   # Quick run with the script
   ./run.sh
   # Choose option 1 (Python) or 2 (Docker)
   
   # OR manually:
   cd main
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python app.py
   ```

3. **Open your browser:**
   ```
   http://localhost:5000
   ```

### Option B: Set Up on GitHub (Recommended for Team)

1. **Create GitHub Repository:**
   - Follow instructions in `GITHUB_SETUP.md`
   - Or go to github.com and create new repo called `flask-lab-project`

2. **Push your code:**
   ```bash
   cd flask-lab-project
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit: Complete Flask lab project"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/flask-lab-project.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. **Add team members as collaborators**

4. **Watch the CI/CD pipeline run automatically!**
